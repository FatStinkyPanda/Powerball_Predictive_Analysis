## ‚ú® Features

- **Date Range Selection**: Analyze Powerball drawings from specific date ranges
- **Advanced Pattern Analysis**: Identifies hot numbers, cold numbers, common pairs, and more
- **Multiple Prediction Algorithms**: Uses various statistical methods to generate predictions
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Visual representation of number frequencies and patterns
- **Multiple Prediction Sets**: View the top prediction and multiple runner-up sets
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Data Breakdown**: Detailed view of the analyzed drawing data

### Prediction Algorithms

The application uses several algorithms to identify patterns:

- Frequency analysis (hot and cold numbers)
- Pair frequency analysis
- Overdue number identification
- Sum pattern analysis
- Even/odd distribution analysis
- Weighted random selection

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local web server (optional, for local development)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/powerball-predictor.git
   cd powerball-predictor
   ```

2. No build process is required as this is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript application.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory with a local web server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python's built-in server
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```

## üìñ Usage

1. **Select Date Range**:

   - Choose a start and end date for the analysis
   - The application will analyze Powerball drawings within this range

2. **View Predictions**:

   - The top prediction will be displayed first
   - Use the dropdown to view additional runner-up predictions
   - Each prediction includes 5 white balls and 1 Powerball

3. **Explore Analysis**:

   - Switch to the Analysis tab to view detailed patterns
   - See frequency charts for all numbers
   - View hot and cold numbers
   - Explore common and rare number combinations

4. **Review Raw Data**:
   - The Raw Data tab shows all drawings used in the analysis
   - Verify the source data that predictions are based on

## üîç How It Works

### Data Retrieval

The application parses Powerball drawing data from the Powerball website content. It extracts:

- Drawing dates
- White ball numbers (5 numbers from 1-69)
- Powerball numbers (1 number from 1-26)
- Power Play multipliers

### Analysis Process

1. **Frequency Analysis**:

   - Counts occurrences of each number (1-69 for white balls, 1-26 for Powerballs)
   - Identifies hot numbers (most frequent) and cold numbers (least frequent)

2. **Pattern Recognition**:

   - Finds number pairs that frequently appear together
   - Identifies rare combinations
   - Analyzes sum patterns of winning numbers
   - Determines common even/odd distributions

3. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Uses weighted random selection based on identified patterns
   - Gives higher probability to numbers that match multiple patterns
   - Ensures results match historical even/odd distributions
   - Generates multiple prediction sets with varying parameters

### Algorithms

The core prediction algorithm applies weights to each number based on:

- Base frequency weight
- Hot number boost (+50%)
- Cold number slight boost (+20%)
- Overdue number boost (+30%)
- Common pair affinity
- Even/odd pattern matching

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This application is provided for **entertainment purposes only**. Past Powerball drawing results do not guarantee future outcomes. The predictions are based solely on statistical analysis of historical data and should not be used as a guarantee of winning. Always gamble responsibly.

The application does not store or track any personal data. All analysis is performed locally in your browser.

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Does this application guarantee winning numbers?**  
A: No. The application uses statistical analysis to identify patterns, but lottery drawings are random events. No prediction method can guarantee winning numbers.

**Q: How accurate are the predictions?**  
A: The predictions are based on statistical patterns from past drawings. While the algorithms identify legitimate patterns, past results do not influence future random drawings.

**Q: Does the application use real Powerball data?**  
A: Yes. The application parses actual Powerball drawing data from the official Powerball website for the date range you specify.

**Q: How often should I update the analysis?**  
A: For the most current analysis, update after each new Powerball drawing (typically Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday nights).

**Q: Can I use this for other lottery games?**  
A: Currently, the application is specifically designed for Powerball. Support for other games may be added in future updates.

**Q: Is this application affiliated with Powerball or the Multi-State Lottery Association?**  
A: No. This is an independent application and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to Powerball or the Multi-State Lottery Association.
